# Homelab Security Lab

## Purpose
This repository documents my journey building a secure, enterprise-style homelab.
The goal is to manually learn networking, security segmentation, logging, and observability
before gradually introducing automation.

## Technologies (Planned)
- Proxmox VE
- pfSense (Firewall, VPN, DNS filtering)
- Splunk (UF, HF, Indexers, Search Head)
- Cribl
- Docker
- GitHub
- AI-assisted analysis (manual-first)

## Learning Philosophy
- Build everything manually first
- Understand before automating
- Use GitHub for documentation and change tracking
- Apply least-privilege and zero-trust principles

## Status
Planning and documentation phase.
